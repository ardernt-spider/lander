# Background Music

To add background music to the Lunar Lander game:

1. Create an audio file (OGG or MP3 format recommended)
2. Name it `background.ogg` or `background.mp3`
3. Place it in the `assets/` directory
4. The game will automatically load and play it when started

## Music Requirements

- Format: OGG (preferred) or MP3
- The music will loop continuously
- Volume is set to 30% by default
- If no music file is found, the game runs normally without audio

## Creating Music

You can create music using:
- Free tools like LMMS, Audacity, or GarageBand
- Online music generators
- Royalty-free music libraries

The music should be ambient/space-themed to fit the lunar landing theme.
